# Linear-Equation-Solver

We will implement a root finder program which takes as an input the equation, the technique to use and its required parameters (e.g. interval for the bisection method).

This project aims to compare and analyze the behavior of numerical methods studied in class {Bisection, False-position, Fixed point, Newton-Raphson, Secant}.
